This Application is a physics simulation of n-particle collision.
This Simulation was desgined as a practice, while I was trying to understand and Implement the concept of Priority Queue.
I was learning Algorithms and Data Structure from Coursera.com at that time.
All this would not have been possible without the excelent teaching of Prof. Robert Sedwig, I would always be in his debt.
Any suggestions and ideas are welcome.
